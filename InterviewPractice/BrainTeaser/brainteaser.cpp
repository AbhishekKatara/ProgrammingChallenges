1.  We're playing a game of Russian Roulette. I take
 2 consecutive bullets out of the 6 bullet revolver and spin the chamber.
  I go first and shoot the bullet at my head, which misses.
  I then pass the gun to you, where you have the option of
spinning the chamber, or shooting. Which would you do to maximize your probability of not dieing?
Don't spin. 1/2 chance without spinning, 1/3 chance with spinning.
This is mainly for Microsoft

    // else , measure 2 from the heavier
    //      if same weight, the remaining must be heavier
    //      else the heavier weight is the heavier weight.
