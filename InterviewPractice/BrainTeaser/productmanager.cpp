User Privacy
    Options to opt out of data collection. 
    The right to be forgotten. 
    Life is on the line, location of user etc. 
    Data can still be targeted: 
        Postal code, male, age etc. filter until one individual. 
        Privacy is important especially for celebrities. 
        Use user data for user benefit
        Strong privacy practices ( use https instead of http)
        Make user data collection transparent
        Give user meaningful choices to protect privacy 
        Be responsible for information we hold. 
        Street view had pictures of users and license plates (blurred) 
UX
    User Experience:
        Ads 
        ENG, PM, UX
        You’re not the user. 
        Size of keyboard (change size reduce typing error rate) 
        Prototype & Iterate
        Details Matter (e.g. Keyboard size) 
        User’s don’t know what they want, just asking doesn’t work. 
        User wants to get from point A to B, 
        BUT user will just say faster horse, but you come up with car. 
        Get root to problem by asking recursive “Why’s”
        Understanding experience of users. 
        What resources are available to you. 
    Accessibility: 
        Every single device
        Every part of the world & language & culture
        Every internet speed. 
        Every use case
        Every privacy 
        Competition is only 1 click away. 
        Company has a terrible wifi connection on purpose (drops 15 packets on purpose) 
        Takes 30 seconds to load youtube
        Internationalization
        Machine Intelligence 
        Next Billion Users
        Find use case
        Open Source and IP
        Privacy & Security
        User Experience
        Figure out what user wants. 
        A/B Experiment
        Data-driven 
        Getting details and pictures for ux is similar to coding for engineers. 
        If do not measure before, there is no after. 
        Record benchmarking so that you can show results after. 
        Given users with disability alternate ways to access products. 
        Users with 3rd party assistive technologies that aren’t supported. 
        Assistive Technologies:
            Sip & Puff
            Captioning 
            Braille Display 
            Screen reader
        Button shouldn’t be an image, but should be a button (using html’s button tag) so that accessibility can use it. 
    Experience: 
        Thought it wasn’t working at first. 
        Try using the accessibility assuming you have bad accessibility problems. 
        There’s no replacement to staring at the user in person.
        Design the IDEAL Wallet
        Design the IDEAL Wallet for blind people in Asian contries. 
    User: 
        Poor
        Uses cash instead of cards 
        Can’t idenfity how much money they are holding
        Notice how the goal is still the same:
        Store money
        But the design of product changes completely
        Work with all the teams. 
        Top 10 apps at every country is different. 
    Internationalization:
        Name + “ added “ + number + “ person to his circles. “
        Problems:
            What if number > 1 ? => “persons”
            What if gender(name)==girl? => “her”
            UTF-8 and not UNICODE 
            Sorting of names is different in other languages.

            Red colored money on screen in China is good, but red colored money on screen in US is bad 
            Make sure your message is translatable and cultural acceptable. 
            Super long words in other languages may not fit in screens. 
            Internationalization Libraries for formatting library.
