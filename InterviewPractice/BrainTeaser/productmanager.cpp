User Privacy
    Options to opt out of data collection. 
    The right to be forgotten. 
    Life is on the line, location of user etc. 
    Data can still be targeted: 
        Postal code, male, age etc. filter until one individual. 
        Privacy is important especially for celebrities. 
        Use user data for user benefit
        Strong privacy practices ( use https instead of http)
        Make user data collection transparent
        Give user meaningful choices to protect privacy 
        Be responsible for information we hold.

UX
    User Experience:
        Ads 
        ENG, PM, UX
        You’re not the user. 
        Size of keyboard (change size reduce typing error rate) 
        Prototype & Iterate
        Details Matter (e.g. Keyboard size) 
        User’s don’t know what they want, just asking doesn’t work. 
        User wants to get from point A to B, 
        BUT user will just say faster horse, but you come up with car. 
        Get root to problem by asking recursive “Why’s”
