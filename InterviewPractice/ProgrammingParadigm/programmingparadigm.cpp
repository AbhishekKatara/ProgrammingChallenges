    Object-Oriented = Everything is an object
    Declarative = Program state the result you want, not how to get it.

Object-Oriented = Everything is an object
    - Languages: Java, C++

Functional (Applicative) — Computation proceeds by (nested) function calls that avoid any global state.
Function-Level (Combinator) — Programs have no variables. No kidding.
Object-Oriented — Computation is effected by sending messages to objects; objects have state and behavior.
Class-based — Objects get their state and behavior based on membership in a class.
Prototype-based — Objects get their behavior from a prototype object.
Event-Driven — Control flow is determined by asynchronous actions (from humans or sensors).
Flow-Driven — Computation is specified by multiple processes communicating over predefined channels.
Logic (Rule-based) — Programmer specifies a set of facts and rules, and an engine infers the answers to questions.
Constraint — Programmer specifies a set of constraints, and an engine infers the answers to questions.
Aspect-Oriented — Programs have cross-cutting concerns applied transparently.
Reflective — Programs manipulate their own structures.
Array — Operators are extended to arrays, so loops are normally unnecessary.
